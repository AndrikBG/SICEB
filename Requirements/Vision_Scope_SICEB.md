## **2. Business Context**

### **Background and Problem Statement**

The **Private Wellness Integrated Clinics Network** is a private health organization that provides various specialized medical services in the city. The clinic operates as a **medical teaching institution**, attending to patients while training medical residents (levels R1 to R4).

**Medical Services Offered:**

1. General Consultation
2. Emergencies
3. Internal Medicine
4. Pediatrics
5. Gynecology and Obstetrics
6. Internal Clinical Laboratory
7. Internal Pharmacy
8. Electronic Clinical Record (to be implemented)
9. Management and assignment of medical personnel
10. Supervised internal training services

**Business Objectives:**

The clinic seeks to achieve the following strategic objectives:

- **Financial Management:** Efficiently record income and expenses per service, generate financial profitability reports.
- **Client Management:** Maintain centralized digital records with complete care history.
- **Inventory Management:** Rigorous control of medical supplies, materials, and medications.
- **Personnel Management:** Control over attending physicians and residents, registration of training activities.

**Current Problem:**

Currently, the clinic operates with **completely manual processes** that result in:

- **Operational Slowness:** Processes based on Word documents and face-to-face meetings.
- **Lack of Material Control:** No visibility of total inventory or material expenditure per service.
- **Fragmented Records:** Each service maintains its own paper templates; there is no consolidation of patient information.
- **Inefficient Personnel Management:** Manual registration of training activities for residents and attending physicians.
- **Slow Financial Reports:** Manual generation of income and expense reports consumes valuable time.

### **Needs**

Below are the needs that the organization has and that would allow it to solve its problems:

|ID|Description of the Need|
|---|---|
|NEC-01|Control of material per service and general clinic material|
|NEC-02|Automated registration of requested, approved, and delivered supplies|
|NEC-03|Centralized digital client/patient record accessible by all medical services|
|NEC-04|Registration of workshops, trainings, and training activities for attending physicians and residents|
|NEC-05|Registration of economic income by service and patient type|
|NEC-06|Registration of economic expenses by service (expenses on supplies, materials, medications)|
|NEC-07|Automated generation of financial reports of income, expenses, and profitability|
|NEC-08|System access control by user with permissions differentiated by role|
|NEC-09|Generation of supply request reports (history, status, frequency)|
|NEC-10|Validation of resident restrictions according to level (R1, R2, R3, R4)|
|NEC-11|Control of regulated medications with complete traceability|
|NEC-12|Management of differentiated discounts for students (30%) and workers (20%)|

## **3. Solution Vision**

### **Vision Statement**

The **SICEB** system will be a **web application** that will automate and centralize the management of information related to the business model of the **Wellness Integrated Clinics Network**.

The system will allow:

- Registration and consultation of **consolidated electronic medical records**
- Management of **inventories with automatic alerts** (materials, medications, reagents)
- **Digitized requests and approvals** (supplies, workshops)
- Control of **medical personnel with level restrictions** (R1-R4)
- **Automated financial reports** (income, expenses, profitability)
- **Critical validations** (prescriptions, stock, supervision)
- **Complete traceability** (controlled medications, dispensations, consultations)

This system should **optimize time**, **improve operational control**, and **provide a better experience** to all involved (administrative staff, physicians, residents, patients).

### **Future Key Business Processes**

The business processes after implementing SICEB (TO BE) are as follows:

|Process ID|Process Name|Description and Steps|
|---|---|---|
|PROC-01-FUT|Digitized Material Request|**Description:** Automated supply request.<br/>**Steps:**<br/>1. Manager accesses SICEB and creates digital request<br/>2. SICEB automatically notifies the administrator<br/>3. Request is recorded with timestamp and traceability<br/>**Improvements:** Complete traceability, automatic notifications, searchable history|
|PROC-02-FUT|Digital Approval of Requests|**Description:** Approval/rejection with system record.<br/>**Steps:**<br/>1. Administrator reviews request in SICEB<br/>2. Approves/rejects with justification in system<br/>3. SICEB automatically notifies the manager<br/>4. Decision is permanently recorded<br/>**Improvements:** Reason recording, automatic notifications, request reports|
|PROC-03-FUT|Digital Material Delivery|**Description:** Delivery registration with digital receipt.<br/>**Steps:**<br/>1. Administrator records delivery in SICEB<br/>2. Manager confirms receipt in SICEB<br/>3. Inventory updates automatically<br/>**Improvements:** Digital receipt, automatic inventory update, traceability|
|PROC-04-FUT|Automatic Consumption Registration|**Description:** Registration of supplies used in consultations.<br/>**Steps:**<br/>1. During/after consultation, physician registers supplies in SICEB<br/>2. System updates inventory in real time<br/>3. System generates alerts if stock drops below minimum<br/>**Improvements:** Real-time visibility, automatic alerts, cost calculation per consultation|
|PROC-06-FUT|Electronic Medical Record|**Description:** Creation and update of consolidated digital record.<br/>**Steps:**<br/>1. Upon registering new patient, system creates unique record<br/>2. Each service adds information to the SAME record<br/>3. Record is IMMUTABLE (cannot be edited, only consultations added)<br/>4. Record accessible from any medical service<br/>**Improvements:** Total consolidation, no duplication, complete history, multi-service access|
|PROC-09-FUT|Digitized Medical Attention|**Description:** Care with system support.<br/>**Steps:**<br/>1. Patient arrives, reception searches/creates patient in SICEB<br/>2. System applies automatic discount by type (Stu 30%, Work 20%)<br/>3. Physician/resident accesses complete record in SICEB<br/>4. System validates resident restrictions (R1 cannot prescribe controlled meds)<br/>5. If prescribed, pharmacy validates prescription in SICEB before dispensing<br/>6. System verifies stock before dispensing<br/>7. Payment recorded in SICEB with digital receipt issuance<br/>**Improvements:** Consolidated record, automatic validations, restriction control, traceability|
|PROC-10-FUT|Digital Lab Processing|**Description:** Request and digital registration of studies.<br/>**Steps:**<br/>1. Physician requests study in SICEB<br/>2. System registers request and charges automatically<br/>3. Lab sees pending requests in SICEB<br/>4. Lab enters results (text) in SICEB<br/>5. Physician consults results in patient record<br/>**Improvements:** Complete traceability, results in record, no lost orders|
